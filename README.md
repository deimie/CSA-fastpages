# Welcome to my [Fastpages Portfolio](https://deimie.github.io/fastpages/)!

All of the work done in this repository was during my enrollment in CSA during 2022-2023. This is a compilation of all the work that I completed as mandatory assignments. Everything that I programmed (non auto-generated fastpages stuff) is in HTMl/CSS, Javascript, Java, and Bash. My work is mostly documented in Jupyer Notebooks which are are all located in the ```posts``` section. I also took class/learning notes on my ```notes``` and ```blog``` pages.
