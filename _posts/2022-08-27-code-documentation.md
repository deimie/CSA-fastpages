## Lesson 1
Lesson 1 is simply an introduction to the course. It talks about how CSA students are taught to think similarly to software engineers, and how we will continue to grow form this.

 ## Lesson 2
 In lesson 2, we learn about the basic structure of a java header, as well as some basic syntax. Below is a basic java header.
 ```
public class className {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  
  }
}
 ```
 
 - The ```main``` method is the most common method used as an entry point to any java program. 
 - The ```public``` method is simply a method that makes the scope of the code global. It's kind of in the name.
 - ```static``` means that there will only be one type of this method and that it will be shared. Basically, we can call the ```main``` method multiple times without creating a new object.
 - ```void``` means there will be nothing returned from the ```main``` method.
 - ```String[] args``` - The ```main``` method's argument is an array of ```string``` type. THis allows the method to accept command line arguments, which are stored as ```string```s in this variable. ```args``` can be changed.

## Lesson 3
To instatiate a new object you use the syntax: ```className objectName = new className();```

## Lesson 4
Lesson 4 was just lots of tedious programming challenges using the things we already learned from the first 3 lessons. There were 4 different challenges where we controlled a painter. These challenges made it almost muscle memory to call objects in java.

## Lesson 5
Lesson 5 was similar to lesson 4, by having many challnges to complete, except now the ```if``` statement was introduced.
