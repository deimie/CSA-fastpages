## Lesson 1
Lesson 1 is simply an introduction to the course. It talks about how CSA students are taught to think similarly to software engineers, and how we will continue to grow form this.

 ## Lesson 2
 In lesson 2, we learn about the basic structure of a java header, as well as some basic syntax. Below is a basic java header.
 ```
public class className {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  
  }
}

 ```
 
 - The ```main``` method is the most common method used as an entry point to any java program. 
 - The ```public``` method is simply a method that makes the scope of the code global. It's kind of in the name.
 - ```static``` means that there will only be one type of this method and that it will be shared. Basically, we can call the ```main``` method multiple times without creating a new object.
 - ```void``` means there will be nothing returned from the ```main``` method.
