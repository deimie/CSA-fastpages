This week we had to work on a lesson for java conditionals, and I also decided to add documentation about De Morgan's law. The basic run down is that an ```if``` 
statement will return an output if a set condition is met. An ```else if``` statement will execute if it's own condition is met so long as the 
intial ```if``` statement's condition was not met. An ```else``` statement has the final say at the bottom of the block meaning that if no other conditions were met,
it will output. ```else``` and ```else if``` do not need to be included however, and the ```if``` statement can be used alone.

De Morgan's law is the principle that applying ```NOT``` logic to ```AND``` logic will flip it to ```OR``` logic. The same is true in reverse.

This week we also had our human day where we discussed how happiness is mostly a choice. A good amount of the happiness we derive comes from the choice to be happy. 
There are of course scenarios that help with promoting happiness such as wealth or success. At the end of the day, it's all down to the person. Personally, having enough
money to get by boosts my happiness, but money is certainly not a huge priority in this case. Often times people with too much money end up losing personal connections  
and relationships with people they once knew well. All in all, happiness is a very fickle thing that will always remain important to try to maintain in whatever way
works best for you.
