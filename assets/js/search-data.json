            "content": "Lesson 1 . Lesson 1 is simply an introduction to the course. It talks about how CSA students are taught to think similarly to software engineers, and how we will continue to grow form this. . Lesson 2 . In lesson 2, we learn about the basic structure of a java header, as well as some basic syntax. Below is a basic java header. . public class className { public static void main(String[] args) { } } . The main method is the most common method used as an entry point to any java program. | The public method is simply a method that makes the scope of the code global. It’s kind of in the name. | static means that there will only be one type of this method and that it will be shared. Basically, we can call the main method multiple times without creating a new object. | void means there will be nothing returned from the main method. | String[] args - The main method’s argument is an array of string type. THis allows the method to accept command line arguments, which are stored as strings in this variable. args can be changed. | . Lesson 3 . To instatiate a new object you use the syntax: className objectName = new className(); . Lesson 4 . Lesson 4 was just lots of tedious programming challenges using the things we already learned from the first 3 lessons. There were 4 different challenges where we controlled a painter. These challenges made it almost muscle memory to call objects in java. . Lesson 5 . Lesson 5 was similar to lesson 4, by having many challnges to complete, except now the if statement was introduced. .",
